a mod to mount the LGX Lite to the current X Carriage   requires:  
4* M3x12 SHCS

new chain mount needs to be printed and tested properly before i upload, the current one collides with the cable chain at low X values  
currently using(unlikely to change): 
2* M3x30 SHCS (low head to match the originals but regular work)  
2* M3x20 threaded spacer  
2* M3x12 BHCS (anywhere between 8 and 14mm)
